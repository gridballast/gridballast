# Getting Started
1. Install the `xtensa-esp32-elf` toolchain by following the instructions here: http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/#setup-toolchain.
   Make sure the `xtensa-esp32-elf/bin` is added to your `PATH`.
1. Clone the repository
    ```
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/WiseLabCMU/gridballast.git
    ```
1. Setup the `IDF_PATH` environment variable by adding the following to your `~/.profile`:
    ```
    export IDF_PATH="<path/to/gridballast>/Support/esp-idf"
    ```
1. Build the controller module
    ```
    $ cd Source/framework
    $ make
    ```
    In the framework configuration, navigate to "Serial flasher config" and select the default serial port. This can be determined by checking which device appears in `/dev` when the controller module is connected via USB. It should start with `/dev/ttyUSB`.
    Save and exit the configuration interface.
1. Flash the controller
    ```
    $ make flash
    ```
